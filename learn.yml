# This is how you comment in a YAML file, using the hash symbol (#)

# The main structure in YAML files are key value pairs. The key is separated from the value by a colon (:). 

name: Cole Palmer 
height_cm: 188
sports_played: football

# In the above example, we have defined three key-value pairs. See how the height_cm is colored differently from the other keys. 
# This is because it is an integer which is a different data type from the other keys which are strings.
# We can define the integer to explicitly be a string by enclosing it in double quotes. 

height_cm_: "188"

# Now we can say that a person does not only play one game, but multiple games. For this we can use an array in YAML. It is defined as follows

sports_played:
  - football
  - cricket
  - basketball

# In the above example, we have defined an array of sports that the person plays. 
# Another way of defining an array is using the square brackets [] and each element is separated by a comma.

sports_played: [football, cricket, basketball]

# YAML also supports nested data structures. These type of data structures are called dictionaries or maps.
# For example, we can define a person's details as follows:

person:
  name: Cole Palmer
  height_cm: 188
  sports_played:
    - football
    - cricket
    - basketball

# We can also combine maps and arrays to describe more complex data structures.
# For example, we can define a list of persons as follows:

persons:
  - name: Cole Palmer
    height_cm: 188
    sports_played:
      - football
      - cricket
      - basketball
  - name: Roger Federer
    height_cm: 175
    sports_played:
      - tennis
      - basketball


# GitHub Actions also makes use of | symbol to indicate a multi-line string that preserves new lines
